Minimal Computing 2017
Instructors: Kim Martin and John Fink

The intention of this course is to get participants comfortable exploring minimal physical computing, which in this case refers to micro 
computers like the Raspberry Pi and Arduino. The course is structured over four days, with a brief meeting in the morning for discussion, 
hands-on guided instruction in the morning, and a theory driven discussion after lunch, followed by experimentation with the day's lessons to wrap up each day.
